### Results:
**Full Precision**
- [[Full Precision No Adaptor Income Statement| No Adaptor]] ✅
- [[Full Precision GPT Dataset Adaptor Income Statement| GPT Dataset Adaptor]] ✅
- [[Full Precision Full Dataset Adaptor Income Statement| Full Dataset Adaptor]] ✅

**4 Bit Precision**
- [[4 Bit Precision No Adaptor Income Statement| No Adaptor]] ✅
- [[4 Bit Precision GPT Dataset Adaptor Income Statement| GPT Dataset Adaptor]] ✅✅
	- At least this one mentions some specific products 
- [[4 Bit Precision Full Dataset Adaptor Income Statement| Full Dataset Adaptor]]: ✅✅
	- Also mentions specific products

These are all pretty equally not great honestly. Mainly just because of the huge amount of repetition in every one. Doesn't seem like the LoRA accomplished much on this specific document type. This is to be expected as the data contained in the GPT dataset was not structured with income statements in mind and the data in the other dataset was largely sentiment based and hence also not particularly relevant.
