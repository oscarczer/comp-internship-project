Management's Discussion and Analysis:  
The Company experienced a difficult year in 2022, with revenue declining 15% compared to the previous year. The net loss increased to $5.2 million, up from $3.5 million in the previous year. The decline in revenue was primarily due to increased competition in the cyber security market, as well as delays in the development of new products.  

The Company's financial position remains strong, with total assets of $46.9 million and total liabilities of $20.3 million. However, the Company's stockholders' equity has declined 12% compared to the previous year, due to the net loss.  

Outlook:  
Looking ahead, the Company expects to continue to face challenges in the cyber security market, but is committed to developing new products and services to meet the growing demand for cyber security solutions. The Company is also exploring new markets and opportunities to diversify its revenue streams.
