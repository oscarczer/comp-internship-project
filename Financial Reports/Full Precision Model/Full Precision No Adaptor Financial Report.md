Cash and Cash Equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 were $1,200,000, a decrease of $500,000 from the previous year. This decrease is primarily due to the company's investment in research and development, which resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents.  

Revenue  
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $8,000,000, a decrease of $1,000,000 from the previous year. This decrease is primarily due to the company's decline in sales, which resulted in a decrease in revenue.

Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $10,500,000, an increase of $1,500,000 from the previous year. This increase is primarily due to the company's investment in research and development, which resulted in an increase in expenses.  

Net Loss  
The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2,500,000, an increase of $1,500,000 from the previous year. This increase is primarily due to the company's decline in sales, which resulted in a decrease in revenue and an increase in expenses.  

Conclusion  
Bpple Inc. has not performed well in the past financial year, with a decline in revenue and an increase in expenses resulting in a net loss. However, the company's investment in research and development may lead to future growth and profitability.
