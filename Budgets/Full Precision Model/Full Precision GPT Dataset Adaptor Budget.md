For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a net income of $2,000,000, an increase of $500,000 from the prior year. The Company's revenue increased by $1,000,000, or 10%, to $11,000,000, primarily due to the increased demand for its cyber security solutions. The Company's earnings per share were $0.50, an increase of $0.10 from the prior year.

Based on the Company's performance in the previous year and the increasing demand for its cyber security solutions, the Company has set the following budget for the upcoming year:  

Revenue: $12,000,000

The budget assumes that the Company will continue to grow its revenue and profitability, driven by the increasing demand for its cyber security solutions. However, the budget also takes into account the potential risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for increased competition in the cyber security market.
