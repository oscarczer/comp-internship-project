To the Board of Directors, 

We have reviewed the financial statements of Bpple Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2022, and are pleased to present this prospective budget for the year ending December 31, 2023. As you are aware, the company has performed well in the previous financial year, with a significant increase in revenue and profitability. We believe that this trend will continue in the coming year, driven by the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions and the company's expanding product line. 

Revenue 
We anticipate that revenue will increase by 20% in the coming year, driven by the expansion of our product line and the growing demand for our cybersecurity solutions. This growth will be driven by the following factors:

* Expansion into new markets, including the healthcare and financial sectors, where the demand for cybersecurity solutions is particularly high. 
* Continued growth in our subscription-based services, which provide ongoing support and updates for our customers. 

Cost of Goods Sold 
We anticipate that the cost of goods sold will increase by 15% in the coming year, driven by the growth in revenue and the increasing costs of raw materials and manufacturing. This growth will be driven by the following factors: 
* Increased costs of raw materials, particularly in the areas of memory and storage, which are critical components of our CyberShield product. 
* Increased labor costs, as we hire additional staff to support the growth of the company. 

Gross Profit 
We anticipate that gross profit will increase by 25% in the coming year, driven by the growth in revenue and the increasing gross profit margins. This growth will be driven by the following factors: 
* Increased sales of our CyberShield product, which has a gross profit margin of 70%. 
* Expansion into new markets, where the gross profit margins are higher than those in our existing markets. 

Operating Expenses 
We anticipate that operating expenses will increase by 15% in the coming year, driven by the growth in revenue and the increasing costs of marketing and research and development. This growth will be driven by the following factors: 
* Increased marketing expenses, as we expand our marketing efforts to support the growth of the company. 
* Increased research and development expenses, as we invest in new technologies and products to support the growth of the company. 

Net Income 
We anticipate that net income will increase by 20% in the coming year, driven by the growth in revenue and the increasing gross profit margins, as well as the expansion of our operations. This growth will be driven by the following factors:
